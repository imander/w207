    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
