    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

One of the birgrams that stood out as somewhat odd is \"cheers kent\". This is likely due to a closing of a message from kent.\n"

    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
